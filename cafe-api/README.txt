This mini-project aims to develop a simple REST api. The site is supposed to be a Cafe & Wifi database that registers the "work environment" in each of its elements. 

The backend includes several basic functions, such as add a cafe, update a cafe's info, delete a registered cafe or even get a random cafe from the DB
Of course, these functions corresponds to each of a basic request method (GET-POST-PATCH-DELETE).

The project finalizes with the proper API documentation, which is published in the following URL: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16895261/Tzsfm4zb
You can also access it via the index.html.
