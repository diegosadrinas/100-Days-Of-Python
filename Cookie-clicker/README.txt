This mini-project consists in a program for automate the clicking-buying options in order to play the cookie clicker game. It is basically a game-playing bot.

The game consists in a constant clicking for unlocking new upgrades. the more you click, the more money you have. 

The program has a preset playing time of 5 minutes, but feel free to change it to whatever you want. There is also a pre-stablished delay time for checking for affordable upgrades. That can also be changed to the amount of seconds you prefer.
