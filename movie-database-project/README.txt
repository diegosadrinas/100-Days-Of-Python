The purpose of this project is to practice backend basic skills along with database implementation in Flask.

The site is a movie database and personal ranking. You can look for any movie you like by title. The search form connects to an API that returns every title related. You simply select the title of your choice and it redirects to the home page, where you have all your selected movies.
 
The movies are ranked by rating and the user can update the data or delete the element. The frontend  is a simple bootstrap template, since it wasn't the objective of the project.
