A very simple and minimal website made to keep track of the cafes in town and its "ammenities".
The purpose of this project was to practice some back-end skills with flask. Specifically, the integration between bootstrap, submitted info and the csv file that works as a database.

There is a "hidden" link to add new cafes, which is the "Cafes" word in All Cafes. That redirects you to the add form.

The frontend was already given by the course starting project, so no credits for that.
