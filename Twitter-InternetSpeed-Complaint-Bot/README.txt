This mini-project consists on a simple bot that checks your current internet speed and compares it with the given ISP internet. If it determines that your current speed is below your Internet Plan, then the program will login into the twitter account and tweet your ISP describing the situation.

Needless to say, you'll need to update the data with your ISP twitter account and provide your ISP down speed. 

I chose fast.com over another common speed tests (speedtest for example) simply because it is easy to scrap and identify de needed element. Also, because is far less detailed, which helps with the project's functionality.
