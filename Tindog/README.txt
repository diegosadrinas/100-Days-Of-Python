TINDOG isa one-pager site designed to present an app for making dog dates. As you can see, this is strictly not a python project, but a web development mini-project aimed to practice advanced CSS and Bootstrap 5.
It is, however, included in the Python course roadmap, before introducing full-stack developing with python.
